## The Provisioning of the RDK3

The CYB06447BZI-BLD53 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder. If the unsigned or not properly signed image will be written to the RDK3 PSoC™ 64 – the microcontroller will not boot. 

The “[Secure Policy Configurator](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Secure_Policy_Configurator_1.30_User_Guide-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c8386267f0183a960762a5977)” tool is used for the provisioning of the new RDK3, please refer to the “ModusToolbox™ Secure Policy Configurator user guide”. 

The CYB06447BZI-BLD53 MCU must be powered from a 2.5V power source to be able to complete the provisioning. The RDK3 has an SMPS [Switching Mode Power Supply] which can be easily adjusted to provide 3.3V or 2.5V to the MCU by switching the slide-switch “SW1” on the bottom side of the board.

Please note that the “[Secure Policy Configurator](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Secure_Policy_Configurator_1.30_User_Guide-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c8386267f0183a960762a5977) 1.20” requires the KitProg3 to be set into the CMSIS-DAP mode. Please press the “PROG MODE” button on the RDK3 board's front side once. The DEBUG D5 yellow led will flash indicating the CMSIS-MODE activated.

The evaluation board including the software is for testing purposes only and, because it has limited functions and limited resilience, is not suitable for permanent use under real conditions. If the evaluation board is nevertheless used under real conditions, this is done at one’s responsibility; any liability of Rutronik is insofar excluded.
